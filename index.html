						<h1 id="page-title">Why PC?</h1>
						<p>
							The first thing people ask when they hear about the "PC Master Race" or begin reading this article is, "Is this a real ideology? Is this an actual group?". The answer is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_Master_Race" rel="nofollow">yes, absolutely</a>. One thing we specialize in as a group is education and facts, and this page is the physical embodiment of just that. So... Why PC? What's the big deal with PC gaming? What's wrong with console gaming? Is PC gaming actually superior? Are consoles really hurting the game industry? Everything will be answered in greater detail, but yes: PC gaming is wholly and objectively superior to console gaming. It can fill absolutely any and every need that consoles can. <strong>Any and all</strong> limitations or restrictions holding the PC back are <em>entirely artificial</em> and fabricated by console manufacturers, console developers, and console journalists (essentially, the "console industry") to prolong their relevance and profit. Long has the PC dealt with slander, misrepresentation, console marketing lies, FUD, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/dictionary#wiki_hostageware" rel="nofollow">hostageware</a> from the console industry. That's partially what triggered the creation of this subreddit and formation of our ideology in the first place! Before the rise of the "PC Master Race" communities and ideology, there wasn't any unified group present to fight console industry slander, FUD, hostageware, and marketing lies. This has now changed. PC gaming is no longer a force to be messed with, and there's an army of 500k+ people who have united for the very purpose of making sure PC gaming is properly represented and no longer mistreated. As users of a free, open, and decentralized platform, it's our responsibility as PC gamers to take the place of the support, management, port testing, and other essential duties that a console manufacturer would otherwise handle for its users and its developers. The page you're about to read is the product of several years of hard work from individuals who believe in the PC, who have done all of this for no other reason than to ensure the console industry's damage is limited, and that the truth still has the ability to directly reach you regardless of how much they attempt to bury the truth in marketing lies and negative associations. Strap yourself in, little Timmy. Get some food, water, and music, because this ride doesn't end.

							<em>Forget everything you thought you knew about PC gaming</em>. This article has two goals: to <em>teach</em> readers how to get into PC gaming and take advantage of all its current offerings, and to <em>dispel</em> the myths about PC gaming that the console industry has been spinning up in an attempt to remain on top despite declining relevance. It's 2016 and PC gaming has <em>never</em> been this <em>inexpensive</em>, <em>easy to get into</em>, <em>free of restriction</em>, or <em>more widespread</em> than it is today. Largely to thank for this massive PC growth, consoles have never been as ethically and technologically <em>worse</em> than they are today - and a lot of people are switching. Yes, this is the first time in gaming history where PCs have surpassed consoles in every conceivable way <em>for less money</em> (however, consoles continue to sell due to dishonest marketing, abuse of money and power of their creators, and traditional beliefs held by many gamers). This following page will explain (in detail) how and why the PC is the unquestionably and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_%28philosophy%29" rel="nofollow">objectively</a> superior choice (cheaper, faster, better, more versatile, and more compatible) compared to underpowered and industry-harming PS4 and XBox One "PC imitators". It's also <em>non-linear</em> and can be read in any order that you prefer. This <em>is</em> a very PC-oriented community, so you may be expecting unjustified or illogical <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ci4q2BixHFE" rel="nofollow">fanboyism</a>... however, a large driving force behind the PC movement is <em>because</em> of what it offers. In other words, <em>we chose it because it's awesome</em> - not <em>it's awesome because we chose it</em>.
	    				</p>
	    				<p>
	    					The past seven years of surging growth, competition, and innovation in the industry have improved the PC in almost every regard, largely due to the mobile hardware and efficiency revolution, as well as things like <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/" rel="nofollow">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/" rel="nofollow">Humble Bundle</a>, and <a href="http://www.gog.com/" rel="nofollow">Good Old Games</a>. PC gaming is now cheaper than ever, and console gaming continues to get more and more expensive as the PlayStation &amp; XBox divisions continue to push prices (and their own business operation costs) higher every year. Reading this guide will cost you exactly $0, whereas, in comparison, buying a console and paying for all the extended costs of everything it requires could easily exceed $2,000 in just a few years (not to mention, consoles offer a considerably worse gaming experience)! Honestly, what could it really hurt to read this? <strong>Bookmark this, read it thoroughly, check all the sources, share the link with your friends, and enjoy!</strong>

						<h3>Console gamers are not the common enemy. Modern consoles are.</h3>
						<p>
							I feel it's important to include this information in the article as soon as possible, since a lot of people get the wrong impression going in and don't take information to heart until they realize they're being educated rather than scolded... I should also point out that it's well-known that past consoles outperformed PCs, but that was the past. This is now. Things are different. The openness of the PC was bound to be taken advantage of eventually, and what triggered it is the stagnation of the console market. And, now that the console market has stagnated and the PC is a viable alternative, it's very possible that traditional consoles with total control under a single corporation is entirely going to vanish.
						</p>
						<p>
							Sony and Microsoft give you an inferior system, charge you a lot of extra money for it, and make you hold on to the pieces of junk for 8 years before they give you the option of (measly) upgrades. By selling you these systems, they lock you into their overpriced ecosystem, helping them further the cycle with their ill-acquired money. They don't let you play with friends unless you pay. They don't let you play with friends that bought the other systems at all. They don't let developers directly sell you the game - they charge for dev kits and include royalties, which massively decreases their profits over that of the PC version. When you take into account the business strategy of these companies, you'll find that it's all just one big greedy systematic ripoff of uneducated consumers. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUAeYL7eAdI&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=264" rel="nofollow">They're holding <em>your</em> favorite games hostage</a> on their closed platforms because they <em>know</em> you'll buy into it. If everyone went with a PC and disregarded this disgusting behavior, these developers wouldn't be so easily convinced to support these "next-gen" consoles. So, do yourself and the industry a favor and go with a PC. PC exists because it's an excellent platform and for no other reason than that. Nobody's advertising it. Nobody's cutting deals with Frito Lay to get it stamped on Dorito bags. Nobody's running a 'PC booth' at gaming festivals. PC exists and thrives simply because it is freaking glorious. XBox and PlayStation consoles exist because their parent corporations hijack developers (and games) that people love and cancel ports to competing platforms (other consoles as well as PC), and force fans of these games to pay a 'hardware ransom' to play it. The PC is open, cheap, customizable, and powerful. Your best interests are always at hand, no matter how arrogant some PC gamers may seem when they speak negatively of the "anti-gamer" consoles. For anyone that's offended, I am truly sorry... but if you're going to get offended over this guide then you probably had no intention of giving PC a chance in the first place. Just remember: <strong>PC gaming is superior to console gaming, but the gamers themselves are neither superior or inferior to one another: they're just people with varying degrees of understanding.</strong> Fight the misinformation, fight the false advertising, and fight the anti-gaming console monopoly. Long live freedom, long live affordable and beautiful gaming, and long live the Glorious PC Gaming Master Race!

						<h3>In summary, why should I choose a PC over a console? What can it possibly offer?</h3>
						<p>
							PCs are awesome machines for gaming, work, and entertainment alike for many reasons. This includes, but is not limited to, the following reasons listed below. The sources that follow each bullet point <em>should</em> link to sections within this page, which in turn contain all the sources you'll probably want to see.
						</p>
						<ul>
						    <li>
						    	PC gaming as a whole is much cheaper than console gaming. Especially in the long run, it can be less than half of what a console will cost you. Hidden fees, price hikes, and royalties are abundant for gamers AND developers in the console industry. <sup><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/guide#wiki_.22isn.27t_pc_gaming_more_expensive_than_console_gaming.3F.22" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/guide#wiki_pc_games_are_so_much_cheaper_that_they_alone_can_allow_even_a_high-end_pc_to_undercut_a_console_within_a_single_year" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></sup>
						    </li>
						    <li>
						    	PC hardware offers better bang-for-buck &amp; value than console hardware (same performance for less money, more performance for the same money, or much more performance for a bit more money). <sup><a href="http://www.gamespot.com/articles/149-nvidia-gtx-750-ti-unveiled-plays-titanfall-better-than-xbox-one/1100-6417813/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></sup>
						    </li>
						    <li>
						    	PCs have the freedom to upgrade whenever YOU decide to, not when Sony or Microsoft decide to. If you just got a big paycheck and wanted to sell your R7 260 to a friend for $50 and buy an R9 380 for $150 <em>tomorrow</em>, you could do it.
						    </li>
						    <li>
						    	PCs give you full internal and external control over the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/371ce9/psa_the_graphical_fidelity_triangle/" rel="nofollow">graphical fidelity triangle</a>. Consoles can control neither.
						    </li>
						    <li>
						    	PCs easily work with TVs and monitors, and even multiple of each.
						    </li>
						    <li>
						    	PCs can play nearly every old PC and <em>console</em> game ever made, thanks to its tremendous legacy support, emulator availability, and <a href="http://gog.com/" rel="nofollow">GOG</a>.
						    </li>
						    <li>
						    	PCs can use nearly every console controller ever made, modern ones (PS3/PS4/X360/XO) work without even needing a USB adapter. <sup><a href="http://i.imgur.com/4KJ22cI.jpg" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></sup>
						    </li>
						    <li>
						    	PC games offer a clearer image thanks to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_resolution" rel="nofollow">native resolution</a> and its ability to adjust to any display its plugged into. Console games don't allow resolution adjustments, and will lock to whatever the developer arbitrarily chose. This means that lower resolution displays offer no performance benefit like they do on PCs, because the resolution is never lowered to spare some workload on the GPU (which, on a PC, would mean it could render frames faster). <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-05-13-confirmed-watch-dogs-ps4-900p-xbox-one-792p-both-30fps" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>
						    </li>
						    <li>
						    	Gaming services and "social services" on the PC are completely free, even with online play. (Steam, Galaxy, Desura, Mumble, etc)
						    </li>
						    <li>
						    	Gaming services on the PC offer more functionality than what you pay for on a console.
						    </li>
						    <li>
						    	PCs have better better multiplayer support. (LAN, 16x local multiplayer on the same machine with softXpand)
						    </li>
						    <li>
						    	Using a modern budget GPU yields around 60 frames per second during gameplay with recent game releases. Consoles can barely reach 30FPS most of the time.
						    </li>
						    <li>
						    	Not only can PC's be used for education, entertainment, gaming, and content creation... they're the best at all of these things.
						    </li>
						    <li>
						    	PCs are much more powerful than the PS4 or XBox One <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/builds#wiki_the_next-gen_crusher" rel="nofollow">at the same (traditionally believe to be affordable!) price point</a>.
						    </li>
						    <li>
						    	More exclusives than all the current-gen consoles combined.
						    </li>
						    <li>
						    	More highly-rated exclusives.
						    </li>
						    <li>
						    	PC games have free modifications and enhancements available. Old games and new games alike have player-made content, graphical enhancements, and additions available for free. Even Minecraft. <sup><a href="http://i.imgur.com/GdToiFe.jpg" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></sup></li>
						    <li>
						    	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_PC_titles" rel="nofollow">More games, much larger library</a>.
						    </li>
						    <li>
						    	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_PC_exclusive_titles" rel="nofollow">More exclusive games</a>.
						    </li>
						    <li>
						    	Healthy independent developer scene.
						    </li>
						    <li>
						    	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_free_PC_titles" rel="nofollow">Lots of free games</a>.
						    </li>
						    <li>
						    	Free <a href="http://www.abandonia.com/" rel="nofollow">abandonware</a> titles.
						    </li>
						    <li>
						    	PCs can emulate almost any handheld <em>and</em> stationary console games using freely available emulators. Sometimes even at higher framerates, detail levels, and with better input than the original console permitted! <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_emulators" rel="nofollow"  >[1]</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQC2WI55n60" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://archive.org/details/1964-60FPS-Edition" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></sup>
						    </li>
						    <li>
						    	Increasingly cheaper hardware for the price as new GPUs are released.
						    </li>
						    <li>
						    	Big Picture mode for couch gaming.
						    </li>
						    <li>
						    	Easier to repair and highly modular.
						    </li>
						    <li>
						    	Backward and forward <em>hardware</em> compatibility of ~2 years.
						    </li>
						    <li>
						    	No punishments for repairing.
						    </li>
						    <li>
						    	Can be upgraded if desired.
						    </li>
						    <li>
						    	Easier to upgrade.
						    </li>
						    <li>
						    	Better price-performance than consoles.
						    </li>
						    <li>
						    	Higher framerates. (<a href="http://puu.sh/aU2pn/ba83554d63.webm" rel="nofollow">smoother</a>)
						    </li>
						    <li>
						    	Higher resolutions than consoles (such as 1080p, 1440p, 1600p, 4k, and 8k!) if your display supports it and you have GPU power you're willing to spare. Consoles struggle, <a href="http://www.ign.com/wikis/xbox-one/PS4_vs._Xbox_One_Native_Resolutions_and_Framerates" rel="nofollow">even at 720-900p</a>!
						    </li>
						    <li>
						    	Higher graphical details. (lighting, textures, foliage, particles, shading, weather)
						    </li>
						    <li>
						    	You're probably going to own some sort of PC anyways, why not pay a bit more on top to make it a gaming machine? That alone makes it cheaper than a console.
						    </li>
						</ul>

							The Personal Computer is a <em>constantly</em> evolving platform. It grows in power, capability, and value every single year. It's also free of the control of any single entity, which are why many of these advantages now exist. Rather than being regulated by a single company, control and improvement influence over the PC belongs to everyone equally. Even you, the consumers, have the full freedom to create or sell software, games, and hardware for it. It's being constantly improved by competing companies and individuals all over the spectrum, and all of them are trying to offer you (and potential developers) the best experience possible. Just keep reading!

						<h3>"Why do you care what others buy and play games on?"</h3>
						<p>
							That's a great question. We (the PC gamers) love gaming and the game industry with a burning passion. Unfortunately for the industry, modern consoles are sucking it dry. No, that's not to say <em>every</em> console manufacturer is responsible for this, and it's also not to say the ones that <em>are</em> responsible are doing it <em>all the time</em>, but it's still harmful. Consoles are directly harming developers, gamers, and the PC platform with their petty exclusivity and dishonest marketing wars.
						</p>
						<p>
							Nowadays, the console business is no longer about satisfying gamers and developers; it's about building a monopoly so they can forcefully attract and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR8CVLVmKQs#t=286" rel="nofollow">monetarily drain developers to the point where they can't afford to develop a quality game on a competing platform (Sony has been known to starve developers to the point where they may opt to skip competing game platforms)</a> (hence, bad ports). It's about bribing them if they can't attract them through marketshare (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paid_exclusivity" rel="nofollow">paid exclusivity</a>). It's about doing whatever it takes to lock up as many franchises as possible to your own platform so the competition has none left, which leaves you with more market share (and consequently, power). They've focused so much on killing competing platforms that they have no money left to make the consumers a product that makes them happy. You, as a gamer, should be pissed at what they're doing to you and your favorite games. If you understand this and continue to defend what they're doing simply because of brand loyalty, you really need to reconsider your reasoning. Consoles take away WAY more than they give, and that's all the justification anyone should ever need when they try showing someone better alternatives.

							<strong>Consoles help</strong>: The manufacturers that created and fiercely market them, developers that were purchased by a console manufacturer, and "journalists" that side with them. That's it.
						</p>
						<p>
							In comparison: <strong>The PC helps</strong> all of the following:
						</p>
						<ul>
						    <li>Hardware manufacturers. (Asus, AMD, Gigabyte, XFX, EVGA, Intel, Seagate, etc)</li>
						    <li>Software companies. (Unity Technologies, Adobe, Mozilla, CD Projekt Red, Google, Dropbox)</li>
						    <li>Game creators. (Blizzard, Gearbox Software, Crytek, Valve, CD Projekt Red, id Software, Rockstar, Devolver Digital)</li>
						    <li>PC gamers.</li>
						    <li>Console gamers. (by giving console manufacturers a standard to aspire for, unfortunately they just use marketing to justify shooting for the bottom of the bin)</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							and finally, <strong>PC hurts</strong> all of the following:
						</p>
						<ul>
						    <li>Profit margins of console manufacturers.</li>
						    <li>Developers that signed away their rights or entire existence over to console manufacturers.</li>
						    <li>"Journalists" that rely on pro-console and anti-PC FUD to pay their bills. <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/blog/techflash/2010/06/microsofts_e3_xbox_bribery_makes_journalism_ethicists_squirm.html" rel="nofollow"><sup>[1]</sup></a></li>
