                    Once upon a time, console manufacturers cared about the consumer and made great consoles. They vastly outperformed PCs of the era, and had a great selection of games.
                </p>
                <p class="indented">
                    This guide isn't trying to hide the truth. Back before the 90's, consoles like the SNES, N64, and the rest of the "golden age" consoles all the way down to the original XBox and PS2, blew PCs out of the water. During that time, PCs were barely more than word processors, and cost the average consumer way more than a gaming console. Not to mention that back then, consoles were constantly innovating in attempts to outperform each other and provide the best possible system to gamers everywhere. Gaming as it is now started with the consoles of the early 80s. But, then came 1985. The Apple II and Commodore 64 skyrocketed PC popularity, and ever since then, PCs have been gaining in power, game library, and innovation. And since the stagnation of the XBox 360 and PS3 era, consoles have been becoming less and less of a good investment, while PCs have just been getting better.

                    With all the benefits of modern PCs, the only things that consoles have going for them are market share, high profitability for the companies building them, <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2014-05-29-the-astronauts-in-2014-USD60-for-a-game-is-a-little-insane">expensive games</a>, and exclusives. The third being hardly anything to brag about as a console user.
                </p>
                <p class="indented">
                    Nowadays, consoles aren't geared towards console users anymore, they're geared towards the companies making them. They're made to be as cheap to manufacture and as easy to make a profit as possible. And although the XBox 360 and PS3 used new hardware that wasn't used throughout the game industry, which caused their later games to be better due to better optimization, they were really just gimped PCs. PCs have always been able to use internet, without paying an extra fee for their device. And the services like Netflix and Hulu, that consoles got to use in the last few years before the XBox One and PS4, were on PC first. The only thing that consoles have are exclusives like Halo, Gears of War, and Uncharted. But those games, and other exclusives, aren't exclusive because that's the only system capable of running it, but rather <a href="http://www.gamesradar.com/paying-exclusivity-why-its-here-stay/">because Microsoft and Sony use their ill-earned profits to influence starving developers</a>. With Microsoft and Sony dominating the console industry, (Sorry Nintendo!) their monopolies just make it worse for everyone involved.

                        PCs are always evolving, growing in power, capability, and value every single year. No single entity owns the PC, which allows for all these options for PC users to buy, build, and upgrade with. And directly because of this freedom from a single corporation, everyone making anything for PC, (even the people who made this website), strive to bring the best product to you, the consumer. But, I'm guessing that right now you're a staunch console gamer who loves his/her system. While that's not necessarily bad, let's get the facts straight on PC gaming.

There are <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/articles/149-nvidia-gtx-750-ti-unveiled-plays-titanfall-better-than-xbox-one/1100-6417813/">graphics cards on the market that go for approximately $150 that surpass PS4 and XBox One performance</a>, and full computers can be built for around $500. Lots of people think that to get a PC that can play games, they need to spend more than $750-$1000, which just <strong>simply isn't true</strong>. These inaccuracies are largely due to highly vocal and misinformed masses, and the advertisement of higher end hardware. (Which makes sense when you think about it, companies <em>want</em> to sell their most expensive products) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTGMG2qUMjU">We're not living in the 90's anymore</a>. In reality, PC hardware is the cheapest it's ever been, and anyone, even a complete beginner to PC parts and building, can put together a PC that blows "next-gen" (Or is current gen now?) consoles, which are really just weak PC's with a crippled OS. And if all you want to do is match their 720p resolution and 30 FPS, you can do it for the same price as those consoles, but with all the extra things a computer can do. In fact, <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/articles/149-nvidia-gtx-750-ti-unveiled-plays-titanfall-better-than-xbox-one/1100-6417813/">it's actually hard to find a minimum-range graphics card that can even perform as bad as console graphics these days</a>. The next time someone reminds you that "It's not all about graphics", remind that that they're in luck, because they'll be spending almost nothing on their graphics card to get the performance they deem adequate.

                        You can build a PC on a budget and beat consoles, performance wise. But if you have the money and the desire, you can literally spend thousands, hell millions if you really wanted to, on a computer that would make everyone on Facebook cry in the face of its glory. From quad-graphics cards in SLI/XFire to multi monitor setups, you can build a battlestation worthy of the name. And game developers know that there are people out there with those interests, and with them in mind, they make options in games to make E3 demos look like they're from the 90's. (Ok not really, but you get my point) The misconception here is that some people believe that just because these options exist, they are the only way to play the game, and that they need to buy the latest and greatest "RadForce MegaGigaJiggaFlexx 95-billion Elite Zombie Slayer Edition" to play the game on acceptable settings. Developers know that the average person is not Bill Gates, and so they make sure that their game is playable on a variety of systems, from the low end laptops to the previously mentioned high end beasts. The fact of the matter is, game and software developers know exactly what the average PC specs are, and the things they want most are sales. If they made programs so demanding only $3K+ computers could run, they'd make a tiny fraction of what they wanted. It's almost exclusively the <a href="http://imgur.com/a/KRywv">graphics mods</a> made by people with too much time on their hands (Which in this case is a great thing) that push a game's GPU requirement to $dollar;1,000 or more.

                    <p class="indented">
                        Before you run off and buy a computer, know this: <strong>don't buy a "gaming" desktop/laptop</strong>. (The only time you should is if you are in a position where building a computer/using a desktop is not possible) It's either going to be tremendously overpriced (I'm looking at you, Alienware), or severely underpowered for the price (CyberPowerPC, iBuyPower, and don't even get me started on Apple). Usually, they toss in a good processor such as one from the i7, which is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8e0jnm39lE">completely overkill</a> for an average gaming build, and toss in a crappy $50 graphics card (the most important part in a gaming computer), causing your games to run like crap. You can put new PC hardware in almost any full-size desktop. What I'm saying is, instead of spending $3200 on that Alienware Aurora (yes they get that high, I almost made the mistake of buying one), you can go buy a $400-$500 desktop from Best Buy and slap in a ~$100 graphis card and play modern games very well. Doing just that is no harder than swapping the hard drive in a console, as was the recent trend, and after a moderate (depending on your internet speed) download and install of the card's drivers, you're good to go. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Pnte_niJE">PCPerspective even has their own in-depth video</a> demonstrating and explaining how cheap and easy it is to turn an 'office box' into a gaming machine. However, building is still the best choice, as it will last much longer, and offer better customizability and value.

                        If you wanted virtual reality gaming (and many other forms of entertainment) in its most immersive form, you'll need a PC. High resolution and framerates are <em>absolutely essential</em> for headsets like the Oculus Rift to properly immerse you. The industry's leading VR company said so themselves: <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/oculus-rift-creator-xbox-one-and-ps4-are-far-too-limited-for-what-we-re-planning-1198420">even the next-gen consoles are far too weak to handle they plan on doing</a>. Some people don't want VR, and you may be one them. But simply because you don't want and/or need VR doesn't mean you shouldn't get a PC, it just means that you can save more on your build!

                        Game developers adhere to popular standards when they make their games. Hardware developers adhere to popular standards when they make hardware. Not doing so would gain them a terrible reputation and most likely bankruptcy. Because of this, games on PC don't have the compatibility issues they used to in the DOS days. In the DOS days, there were no standards to adhere to, and there were thousands of different possible hardware configurations. Almost no games worked with every piece of sound, video, and input hardware. The next time you hear someone complain about PC gaming being a pain because they hate 'checking to see if they have enough video RAM' or 'making sure they have a fast enough processor' or 'whether or not their sound drivers are up-to-date', just punch them and link them here. PC game developers make their game compatible with an enormous possible performance spectrum!

You can see what games and servers your friends are currently playing and join the server with the click of a button (and vice versa, you can invite them to yours). You can trade on the <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/market/">Community Market</a> without ever having to hunt someone down that has or wants certain goods. Steam also has an integrated software store, developer store, Workshop (for easier modding), Greenlight, and Big Picture mode for couch gamers. Steam will also automatically sync your saved games and settings to the Steam Cloud. Your in-game Steam panel is pretty awesome, too. It lets you chat, trade, browse the web for walkthroughs and whatnot, track achievements, and much more.

                        Have you ever beat a game and felt the rush of depression when the last cutscene ends and you're sent back to the main menu? Well, on a console, you'd either be done with the game or just play an almost exact playthrough again. Fortunately for PC gamers, there are a plethora of mods for most of our games that extend the replayability for hundreds, even thousands of hours! Mods can add new areas, new gamemodes, new characters, new items, <a href="http://imgur.com/a/KRywv">greatly improve graphics</a>, and the best part is that they're generally very easy to install. This can't be done on a console, without a modded game disc, and then modding your console to accept, which would most likely end with you not being able to play online, and may even get you into some <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2009/08/modder-arrest-a-reminder-that-most-console-hacks-are-illegal/">legal trouble</a>. (However, Nintendo allows <a href="http://projectmgame.com/en/about">modding of the Wii</a>, one of the few consoles that are not evil when it comes to modding). Not to mention, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvNzj0GVMDI"> mod support is tremendously helpful to gamers, games, and developers</a>. Plus, thanks to modding communities, PC games essentially age in reverse. Meaning, they get even better looking as time goes on. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ynxg0xnrLZ0">Take a look at GTA IV as of January 2014 if you don't believe it</a>.

                        If you can prove you work on it, you can write it off. Even it has a R9 290x or a Titan Z. As we've seen in recent years, owning a GPU no longer means you're just gaming, what with all the new porudcitivity tools making use of OpenCL and other GPU compute features. If your work software uses it, the IRS has no business saying you can't play on it as well.

                        Contrary to the uneducated hordes you'd find on YouTube comments, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ie2dN418GTA">you <em>can easily</em> see the difference between 30 and 60 FPS</a>. One major source of this heading (which will soon be fixed) is YouTube itself. People will post "1080p 60 FPS" gameplay, and when people compare that to 30 FPS gameplay on other YouTube videos, they see no difference. This is because YouTube currently caps the framerate at 30, therefore making any videos with a higher framerate a waste of time to compare with. Another source is people's own hardware, though this is mainly when concerning 60+ FPS. Many mainstream monitors are capped between 50 - 60 Hz for their refresh rate, which is how many times the screen can refresh the picture per second. If the refresh rate is lower than your FPS, you'll only see it up to the refresh rate. (And sometimes screen tearing becomes an issue) The last and final source of confusion on this matter is whether or not the human eye can distinguish between the individual frames rather than see them as a slideshow. The answer is no, they cannot... which is the entire point! You can, however, see an improvement in fluidity when the Hz (hertz/refresh rate/FPS) of your system and display are increased. <a href="http://www.testufo.com/#test=framerates">Here's an in-browser 30-vs-60 test if you still don't believe it, and another with actual game footageL</a>.

                        Also, the argument of ~24 FPS providing a cinematic experience is completely false. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110708155615/http://www.cinemaweb.com/silentfilm/bookshelf/18_kb_2.htm">Back when the film industry started to pick up in the 1930s, any framerate higher would use too much physical film, and any lower made it hard to sync audio</a>. Nowadays, more and more movies are starting to use higher framerates during recording.

                    <p class="indented">
                        The majority of console titles target 30 (at 1080p) and occasionally a smooth 60 (although at a meager 720p). Due to the severe hardware limitations of the PS4 and XBox One, almost no titles at the time of this writing are capable of both 1080p and 60FPS. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate#Background">Thomas Edison himself concluded</a> that anything below 46FPS will strain the human eye, with strain increasing as the framerate lowers. This was back in the days of film strips, so the bar is probably a bit lower now than it was then, but eye strain still exists and there's a way to avoid it.

                        It's hilarious that some people would try to argue this, yet they sometimes do. The problem with a lot of console titles is that the developers have to narrow the field of view to reduce the stress on their target console's weaker hardware. To give you a glimpse of what you're missing out on, see <a href="http://i.imgur.com/eXJoz8N.gif">this image</a>. Although some titles have the same field of view across all platforms, ones that are graphically intensive (like Battlefield 4, Skyrim, COD, etc) will often have a reduced FOV on the console version. The best part of it all, if you really do prefer a lower FOV in a given name or need to lower it for medical reasons (vertigo, etc) the PC version will almost always offer an FOV slider or other way to change the FOV. The <a href="http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Category:Games">PCGamingWiki</a> is an absolutely superb resource for information on how to tweak the FOV (among other things, like resolution and detail).

                        Researchers at the University of Massachusetts have <a href="http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~claypool/papers/fr-rez/paper.pdf">determined though observation</a> that not only is the difference noticeable, but player performance increases logarithmically up to 60FPS (logarithmically means the largest increases happen early on and begin to taper off, see rough example <a href="https://people.richland.edu/james/lecture/m116/logs/logarithmic.gif">here</a>). Unfortunately, they didn't test with framerates <em>over</em> 60, so we can intelligently theorize (but not scientifically prove) that this also applies to framerates beyond 60. They also concluded (since the curve is logarithmic) that framerates lower than 30 get almost exponentially worse, which is unfortunate because almost every "next-gen" demo so far has shown to dip as low as 10-20FPS while rendering heavier scenes.

                        Some people claim that consoles get better performance during their lifecycles due to "optimization" and that PCs somehow get slower and need upgrades to keep up. That's just false. While developers will figure out how to better use the console hardware that they have and may make better looking games after some time, they make the same, if not better, optimizations for PC hardware. And really, the optimization argument only applied to the XBox 360 and PS3, as they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K5Opymw0p0">used new hardware that the industry was very unfamiliar with</a> and needed time to learn. This time around, the XBox One and PS4 are using x86-based processors, an architecture used by PCs for a much longer time. Any optimizations made to their games can be done just as well, if not better, on the PC versions.

If you had a PC that's starting to get old and can't run games as well as it used to, you can easily overclock, which isn't as hard or as dangerous as it sounds. (Plus, if it's getting old, there's probably no warranty to void anyway) You could always buy new hardware, but with overclocking, you could squeeze out another year or so of use before hitting up Newegg.

However, mouse and keyboard combinations are just as easy to do if you have a proper piece of furniture to support everything. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kPPv1Lph_o">Here's</a> a video  by BlackBusterCritic explaining how this is possible and fighting the misinformation spreaders that say otherwise. Another big factor is the resolution output of your PC. TVs of today are 1080p and higher; sometimes even 4K (4x as dense as 1080p)! Mainstream consoles can hardly handle 900p, let alone 1080p... Using a PC with these TVs rather than an underpowered console will ensure you hit the level of clarity the TV was designed for, not what the console drags it down to. Any resolution other than a display's native resolution will look blurry in comparison to what it was designed for, and you'll notice this pretty quick when you hook your PC up to your TV.

                        Modern consoles like the PS4 and XBox One use an enhanced AMD A10, which is a mid-range budget processor. Back when the XBox 360 and PS3 came out, things were different. The XBox 360 and PS3 were both very competitive with equivalent PCs, and they were <strong>sold at a tremendous loss, even with their $700 price tags</strong>. Consoles now are being sold for $400-$500 and making healthy profits on the hardware alone, (at least after their first single game and round of online access payments, if not immediately) ... and yet they continue to raise the prices for online access/special services and increase their cuts for per-game sales. The last-gen prices aren't even adjusted to inflation, either! It really says something about console innovation when you have to adjust for inflation to compare across generations, doesn't it?

                        Let's face it. If your device relies on fan cooling or has vents, it's going to get dusty and eventually very hot. If it contains circuit boards, it's going to be susceptible to power surges and other electrical problems. It doesn't matter who builds the products or where it comes from. No electronic device is invulnerable. Luckily for you, you get to handle things yourself if/when your PC has a problem with an individual part. Consoles aren't so forgiving. If you clean it yourself, the warranty is most likely void. If a part fails, you have to send the entire thing in and wait for it to be sent back. Sometimes you can even continue using the PC while waiting for the individual part to be replaced! Things like RAM cards, hard drives, graphics cards are good examples. Get a PC and you won't have to be afraid of voiding a warranty ever again as long as you're not physically violating the warranty agreement for the part. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/2djjFBh.png">Repairing is frowned upon with the XBox most of all</a>.

If the part goes bad within the warranty period, (1-3 years, sometimes lifetime) the company will mail you back a functional replacement. In comparison, a console requires the entire device to be sent in... <a href="http://i.imgur.com/pQPyMK1.png">sometimes <em>after</em> you've already paid more money for the warranty</a>! Disassembling it to send them the defective part would not only be difficult because the warranty would instantly be invalidated on the console, but also because the part is useless to you outside of the device (from a warranty standpoint, they won't honor it or even acknowledge the part belongs to their console).

There are software solutions out there that can essentially add a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal">terminal</a> to your PC and allow a second user to play games and browse in parallel to whatever you're doing without even interrupting each other. All you need is a separate mouse, keyboard, and display. You can turn your single PC into up to 6. <a href="http://www.miniframe.com/technology/softxpand.html">SoftXPand</a> is the only software I know that can do this on Windows.

                        PCs are capable of a lot, and they can save you a lot of money. One such popular method among PC gamers to access their console without buying a dedicated display is to just send their video into the PC and display it on one of their monitors. It saves power, money, and space.

                        <strong>PC gaming is strong and growing, and it's not going anywhere for the foreseeable future</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p class="indented">
                        For those of you that worry about jumping onto a dying horse, worry no more. The PC is profitable, <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/183381/are-pcs-dying-of-course-not-heres-why/">stable</a>, and even growing (in some sectors) in market share <a href="http://techreport.com/news/24575/pc-gaming-market-grew-8-in-2012">every year</a>. Not only is it growing worldwide, but the only areas it has left to win a majority gaming marketshare in are <a href="http://i.imgur.com/kXjMpGa.png">Canada, the US, and Mexico</a>. So if you want to go with what's the healthiest for you and the industry...go PC. The misinformation about PC "dying" is typically spewed by angry people that want to recruit others into the ecosystem that they decided was best (probably just because they were already trapped in it). Developers (the people who make the games that drove you to choose a platform in the first place) also prefer PC, because they don't lose half of their profits to manufacturing and exorbitant fees. Lastly and most importantly, gamers are switching back. Ultimately because <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1ypsxy/why_ive_returned_to_pc_gaming/">the PC is cheaper, more open, customizable, easier to fix, and capable of so much more</a>.

                        <strong>Consoles are no longer the industry innovation leaders</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p class="indented">
                        Back when the SNES/N64/PSX came out, it was a different time. Now, it may seem that consoles are to thank for graphical fidelity making leaps every eight years, but they're not. The reason gaming takes a leap forward every time a new generation of consoles come out is because <em>they're what was holding it back in the first place</em>. Think about it: 70% of the target audience of any given game will have to be playable on continuously aging console hardware. That means that the developers have to make sure that their game will run on said machines, with or without the features they desire. Many of their ideas and features they could have implemented are thrown out the window because the hardware simply can't handle it. As a result, the developers are forced to sell a stripped-down product. Of course, PC users will most often get a better product if the same title lands in their hands, but it's never exactly what the developer originally expected. In some rare cases, the PC port is terrible... but only because the developers are unable to allocate as much time and money to the PC branch of the project. There's a line they have to draw somewhere in between the capabilities of the console and the capabilities of the PC. A fine example of this would be Crysis, a game which launched on consoles <a href="http://i.imgur.com/C0HPPea.jpg"><em>four years</em> after it was released on PC</a>. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="indented">
                        There have been occasional instances where the developer will rebuild the game (graphically) from scratch to make sure that the PC version fulfills their vision, but even that is rare. So... the less people that are purchasing consoles, the less of a stranglehold Microsoft and Sony will have on the industry. The more people that are on PC, the more wiggle room the developers have to make their game the best it can be. If you enjoy seeing games get better, go with a PC.

                        <strong>Hardware companies and game companies make more money from PCs than they do consoles</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p class="indented">
                        Yes, it's true. Even at full price on a console, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCsgzRxIsmY">developers make more money from it being sold on Steam for 75% off</a>. Why? Because developing for PC has no per-sale royalty fees, no development kit fees, no submission fees, and no cost of physically manufacturing/shipping/stocking their finished products. Your money goes straight to the developer's pocket, and the game directly onto your PC. Hardware makers earn much healthier margins on PC as well, since they aren't relying on eventual-profit-by-volume under some tremendously long-term supply contract for Microsoft or Sony. If you care about <a href="http://i.imgur.com/9wvvcag.png">saving money for yourself</a>, go with the PC. If you care about funding developers and keeping your favorite games flowing, go with the PC. If you care about the hardware companies like AMD and nVidia that make modern gaming possible, go with the PC. Once again, consoles exist only to suck money out of developers, hardware companies, and gamers. It's plain as day: Sony and Microsoft don't care about anything but money. If they really cared about improving the state of gaming, why are they sucking every possible entity dry at every possible stage of the process? Literally, for the love of gaming, go with a PC.

                        <strong>Used game sales are more destructive to the industry than piracy and sales</strong>

                    <p class="indented">
                        According to Lionhead studios, this is <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/used-video-games-market-more-damaging-than-piracy-110518/">true</a>. At least for them, anyways. It makes sense that this would affect all console developers equally, though. This won't be an issue much longer, however, because the console industry is beginning to restrict used game sales to the point where your physical game is more like a receipt than an actual game.

                    <p class="indented">
                        There's a lot of undeserved misinformation flying around, usually sounding something like, "PC gamers are a bunch of pirates"/"PC isn't getting this game because they're all pirates"/"Developers did this or that because they're punishing them for being pirates". In reality, as concluded by Intel's research, <a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2012/09/22/gaming-piracy-separating-fact-from-fiction">the majority of piracy you see today takes place on consoles</a>! The massive drop in piracy can likely be credited to easy, cheap, and even free distribution methods and services such as Good Old Games and Steam. Judging by Intel's research, it looks like the only people who really claim piracy is a massive problem on PC are the ones who are known for terrible DRM or hate it purely out of jealousy toward Valve (EA, Ubisoft).

If the XBox team themselves are incapable of convincing you that PC is superior, nothing will. Seeing as <strong>all console games are developed on PCs and then skimmed down for consoles</strong>, it's only natural that they use footage from the best-looking system to try and sell their product. Sony and Microsoft both know that the truth is far from pretty, so they source their media from a high-end PC rather than a console. They think you'll forget by the time you buy their system anyhow. They don't care about it actually looking good, they just expect you to forget by the time you pay them upwards of $500 for everything. The question is, will you let them?

So, do yourself and the industry a favor and go with a PC. It's open, it's cheap, and it's damn powerful. Your best interests are always at hand, no matter how arrogant some of us may seem.

It makes me feel bad knowing that there are people out there with perfectly capable PCs, but they have no idea they can do half of this stuff. It makes me feel even worse knowing that there are people out there that were misled into buying consoles and paying for online access because they had no idea that a measly $100 would have turned their 'office box' into a console crusher. My goal is not to obtain money, karma, or anything else. I just wanted an area to share my knowledge with as many people as possible and I think I've found it here on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/PCMasterRace">/r/PCMasterRace</a>.
