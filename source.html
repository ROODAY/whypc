<p>It's a well thought-out systematic scam that's hurting everyone, including you. Consoles are no longer a 'cool and innovative' thing that developers intentionally choose based on compatibility with their artistic vision (as was the case in the 1980s-1990s before the 'new age' of PC graphics). They're something developers <em>have</em> to work with and water their games down to be compatible with (because they're either a subsidiary of Sony or Microsoft, or they have no other choice), something that many gamers <em>have</em> to buy (because of marketing lies and forced/bribed exclusivity), and that PC gamers <em>have</em> to deal with (because so many people got tricked into buying them and developers prioritize that large and weak-hardwared demographic over the PC). Sony and Microsoft entered the turf of the PC gamer when they attacked our games, our developers, and our industry. Console manufacturers aren't your friends. They're made by conglomerates that know nothing of the game industry and see nothing more than a cash cow when they look at gamers. They don't care about giving you good hardware, good games, or good experiences. They care about making the industry THEIRS and locking everyone in to their deadly cycle and they'll put out any marketing lies they need to to get people to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ci4q2BixHFE?autoplay=1&amp;vq=hd720" rel="nofollow"  >fight for them (they know the psychology, and they know they have the power to trick people into defending them)</a>
    <div wotsearchtarget="youtube.com" style="cursor: pointer; display: inline-block;width: 16px; height: 16px;">&nbsp;</div>. So, if you care about the game industry and innovation, understand this: They're draining the industry dry and putting their "dirty money" in absolutely no places that benefit you or the industry. A world of gaming without consoles holding it back would be an amazing one. The next time you see someone arguing against consoles, just remember this before you confront them: <strong>Sony and Microsoft picked the fight, not us.</strong></p>
<p>Here's an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/3c7wsd/meanwhile_in_an_alternate_universe/cst5udt" rel="nofollow"  >amazing quote</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/MangoTangoFox" rel="nofollow" class="imgScanned userTagged" >/u/MangoTangoFox</a><span class="RESUserTag"><a class="userTagLink RESUserTagImage" username="mangotangofox" title="set a tag" href="javascript:void 0"></a></span> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/guide#" class="voteWeight" style="display: none;">[vw]</a> that helps explain this section:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>It can never be this way because literally all of the platforms except PC are owned by single companies who created said platform(s) primarily to act as middlemen. Every choice made is done to make the most money, and that includes buying up whole game studios and timed/permanent exclusivity of games and services in order to make their's more appealing than the others. PC isn't even vaguely similar because of the fragmentation of manufacturers, service providers, and creators, allows considerable freedom of choice for the consumer, and doesn't really allow or call for paid exclusivity of certain titles.</p>
    <p>If you think of the characters as the companies who own them, all the consoles despise each-other and would do anything to win any competition between them. If you think of them as the consumers that play them, everyone making a different choice forces exclusivity and anyone not wealthy enough to own all platforms and all the games they want, is getting screwed by that system. You can appreciate people who have similar interests, but it's hard to just say "let's all just have fun" when 1. you literally cannot with huge numbers of people because of lack of cross platform multiplayer, and 2. people supporting other platforms allows their greedy existence in the first place, which lessens your own experience as a result because of wasted dev time and paid exclusivity. And even if you own all of them, you still get screwed because the most competent, versatile, and potentially powerful platform you own isn't getting dozens of games you want, and many of the ones it does get aren't anywhere near as amazing as they could have been if the other lesser platforms didn't have so much market/mind-share. So with all the platforms, most of the games that aren't PC exclusive out of necessity in the first place, are likely lesser than they could have been.</p>

    <p>Consoles are bleeding this dry, especially in the big-budget gaming department. Ultimately what happens is hoards of kids put up a brick wall of ignorance and stupidity over a lack of a long-term gaming background, defend consoles, accept bullshit and let console manufactures and their associated developers castrate this industry.</p>
    <p>Its not wrong to own or prefer consoles. I thoroughly understand demographics. Hell, the notion of choice is what PC gamers live by. What I care about is this social engineering and phenomena to systematically reject the that PC platform that is the beating heart of the gaming industry. Its not competing with their precious little gaming boxes, its their support. Kids today are actively segregating their big-money AAA gaming as a separate entity to the open gaming scene found on PC.</p>

<p>Arguments justifying current-gen consoles because of something a past console has provided is the textbook definition of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_tradition" rel="nofollow"  >appeal to tradition</a>
     logical fallacy. Sony and Microsoft are piggybacking off of the successes of past consoles to make their current ones seem relevant, and they'll always have some degree of success there. Appealing to emotions or nostalgia is and always will be a popular marketing tool. Don't let it work on you. Besides, you can run all of these old console games in emulators <em>on your PC</em>.

A lot of people incorrectly believe that you have to spend upwards of $750-$1000 to get a PC fully capable of handling games. This <strong>simply isn't true</strong>! These inaccuracies can be attributed partially to the highly vocal and misinformed masses, and to the availability (and mainstream hype) of the expensive PC hardware we see advertised a lot. You see it more because it's advertised more. Why is it advertised more? Because the companies make more money from selling it as opposed to their mainstream and value offerings. The mainstream/budget parts are the ones you should be looking at; not the $2000+ enthusiast gear. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTGMG2qUMjU" rel="nofollow"  type="IFRAME" data-embed="//www.youtube.com/embed/RTGMG2qUMjU?enablejsapi=1&amp;enablecastapi=1&amp;start=0" data-pause="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;command&quot;,&quot;func&quot;:&quot;pauseVideo&quot;,&quot;args&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-play="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;command&quot;,&quot;func&quot;:&quot;playVideo&quot;,&quot;args&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" name="img152" >We're not living the 90's any more</a>

<p>It also has immediate benefits: No online fees, tons of free-to-play games, free emulators, free abandonware games, much cheaper games thanks to Steam and GOG, re-use old hardware (controller, mouse, keyboard), won't need to upgrade until games start to struggle like they do on consoles (30FPS, low, 900p). </p>
<h3 id="wiki_optimization.3A_as_time_goes_on.2C_consoles_don.27t_get_stronger_and_pcs_don.27t_get_weaker">Optimization: As time goes on, consoles don't get stronger and PCs don't get weaker</h3>
<p>Some people claim that consoles get better over time due to "optimization" and that PCs (on the opposite end) get slower and need to be upgraded to keep up with these "optimizations". This is a lie. Some say it intentionally, and some repeat it because they simply don't know any better. Yes, there is a gradual increase in developer hardware and SDK familiarity after new consoles (or hardware in general) launches. Especially with the XBox 360 and PS3, due to their hardware being exotic and hard to master. These "optimizations" are not exclusive to the consoles, either! The same optimizations are also taken advantage of on the PC when they receive large hardware revisions as well - just take a look at what DirectX 12 and Vulkan are doing for PC gamers! The leading cause of this "console optimization" misconception is likely due to the state of hardware during the launch of the XBox 360 and PS3. When the XBox 360 and PS3 launched, they had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K5Opymw0p0" rel="nofollow"  type="IFRAME" data-embed="//www.youtube.com/embed/5K5Opymw0p0?enablejsapi=1&amp;enablecastapi=1&amp;start=0" data-pause="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;command&quot;,&quot;func&quot;:&quot;pauseVideo&quot;,&quot;args&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-play="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;command&quot;,&quot;func&quot;:&quot;playVideo&quot;,&quot;args&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" name="img161" >entirely new types and mixtures of hardware that the industry was very unfamiliar with</a>

The XBox One and PS4 <strong>simply will not have a similar developer learning curve that the 360 and PS3 had</strong> because both new consoles use x86-based processors (which is also used by PCs!). As for the second part of the argument, loss of value with PC hardware (in comparison to console hardware) doesn't happen at a faster rate. Let's break this down: First off, the 360 and PS3 were sold at a loss when they launched. <strong>Times have changed!</strong> The Xbox One and PS4 are both being sold at a profit after their first game/online purchases (even at $400/$500). Secondly, the performance-per-dollar of desktop GPUs now is noticeably better than it was at the time. Even while taking this into account, a GPU in 2006 (during the 360 and PS3 launch) priced similar to the build price of those consoles is still very much usable today. The best GPU for this demonstration is NVidia's 8800 series. Not only are they still getting driver updates today, but they're also getting support from game developers. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEaQo6pcuNo" rel="nofollow"  type="IFRAME" data-embed="//www.youtube.com/embed/OEaQo6pcuNo?enablejsapi=1&amp;enablecastapi=1&amp;start=0" data-pause="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;command&quot;,&quot;func&quot;:&quot;pauseVideo&quot;,&quot;args&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-play="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;command&quot;,&quot;func&quot;:&quot;playVideo&quot;,&quot;args&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" name="img162" >Here's an example of a modern PC game being played on a high-end desktop PC graphics card from 2006</a>

<p>If you're the kind of person that wants to go all-out and buy a multi-thousand dollar setup with multiple monitors and graphics cards, you have the freedom to do so. Game developers know that a small fraction of the PC gaming market does this, so they add more demanding graphics options for you to make sure that extra hardware doesn't go to waste. A lot of people think that simply because these settings <em>exist</em>, they absolutely <em>need</em> to buy the latest and greatest 'RadForce MegaGigaJiggaFlexx 95-billion Elite Zombie Slayer Edition' graphics card to meet these settings with an acceptable framerate, or 'FPS'. <em>The highest/ultra settings generally aren't created with the majority in mind</em>. Even at low and medium settings, you'll be getting <em>higher resolutions</em>, <em>smoother framerates</em>, <em>better lighting</em>, <em>higher resolution textures</em>, and <em>more detailed scenes</em> than a comparably priced console. The fact of the matter is, both the <em>hardware</em> and <em>software</em> companies know exactly what graphics hardware the average consumer is going to buy and use, and they build their games and hardware accordingly. They're not here to build a game so demanding that you can't play it, and anyone who says so isn't telling you the whole truth. Game developers want <em>sales</em>, and if their game only run on the aforementioned minority enthusiast sector of PCs, they're going to get minority sales to go along with it.

    <div wotsearchtarget="gaben.tv" style="cursor: pointer; display: inline-block;width: 16px; height: 16px;">&nbsp;</div>. Even <em>brand new titles</em> that have yet to be released can occasionally get a pre-order discount or otherwise drop below the traditional console release price of $59.99. There's also the occasional franchise or "studio" bundles that can save you around 25-50%. Summer and winter Steam sales offer the largest discounts, with single titles going as much as 75% off with entire franchises and bundle discounts stacking onto the discount Valve already added to it. Yes, it's true that you may sometimes get games that you don't want from a bundle, but you have to be trying pretty hard when you try to label that as a disadvantage. The games are yours forever, and there's a pretty good chance that someone may want to "borrow" it from you and try it out even if you don't. Over the course of 3-4 years, some people have <a href="http://i.imgur.com/9wvvcag.png" rel="nofollow"   type="IMAGE" name="img173">saved over $3000 by using Steam</a><a class="toggleImage expando-button collapsed collapsedExpando image commentImg">&nbsp;</a>

<h3 id="wiki_the_pc_is_better_equipped_for_online_play_than_a_console">The PC is better equipped for online play than a console</h3>
<p>Since PCs have more processing power and faster networking (as well as modular networking, you can add a faster 10-gigabit ethernet card if you want one). This means (you have the option of) more enemies, more players, more action, much quicker and clearer voice communication, lower game latency, and much more. Developers and hobbyist server hosts have made great leaps with the PC in recent years; some PC servers can support up to <em>10,000</em> players in a single FPS match! Imagine the intensity of 10,000 players compared to a measly 64 player match(which even the latest and greatest consoles have trouble reaching at all).</p>
<h3 id="wiki_pc_games_can_be_modded._console_games_.28legally_and_logically.29_cannot">PC games can be modded. Console games (legally and logically) cannot</h3>
<p>Have you ever beat a game and felt that rush of depression when the last cut-scene finishes and you are sent back to the main menu and the music starts? Probably. Fortunately for PC gamers, there are a plethora of mods available for our games that can be easily installed. Mods can change gameplay logic, add maps or characters, <a href="http://imgur.com/a/KRywv" rel="nofollow" >greatly improve graphical quality</a>

The <em>easiest</em> way you could play a modded console game would be to buy or burn a modded disc image of the game and modify your firmware to accept it, rendering it incapable of online play and possibly even facing <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2009/08/modder-arrest-a-reminder-that-most-console-hacks-are-illegal/" rel="nofollow"  >legal trouble</a>

<p>First of all, <strong>don't ever buy a "gaming" desktop</strong>. EVER. It's either going to be tremendously expensive (Alienware) or severely underpowered for what you pay (CyberPowerPC, iBuyPower, iMac). Most of the time, they toss in a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8e0jnm39lE" rel="nofollow"  type="IFRAME" data-embed="//www.youtube.com/embed/I8e0jnm39lE?enablejsapi=1&amp;enablecastapi=1&amp;start=0" data-pause="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;command&quot;,&quot;func&quot;:&quot;pauseVideo&quot;,&quot;args&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-play="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;command&quot;,&quot;func&quot;:&quot;playVideo&quot;,&quot;args&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" name="img179" >completely unnecessary i7</a>

Second of all, you can put your newly-purchased hardware in any full-size desktop. As long as your PC is relatively decent and you add a ~$100 graphics card to it, you will be able to run modern titles very well. Although, building is still the best choice because it will last much longer and offer better customizability and value.</p>
<p>If you don't want to build one(which is weird, because <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr3MgKkS314" rel="nofollow"  type="IFRAME" data-embed="//www.youtube.com/embed/Sr3MgKkS314?enablejsapi=1&amp;enablecastapi=1&amp;start=0" data-pause="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;command&quot;,&quot;func&quot;:&quot;pauseVideo&quot;,&quot;args&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-play="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;command&quot;,&quot;func&quot;:&quot;playVideo&quot;,&quot;args&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" name="img180" >even a 5 year old can build a PC these days</a>

It's no more difficult than upgrading the hard drive on a console or replacing a home air filter. Once the card is in, just install the drivers for it from the AMD or nVidia website, and your games will be good to go. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Pnte_niJE" rel="nofollow"  type="IFRAME" data-embed="//www.youtube.com/embed/A_Pnte_niJE?enablejsapi=1&amp;enablecastapi=1&amp;start=0" data-pause="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;command&quot;,&quot;func&quot;:&quot;pauseVideo&quot;,&quot;args&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-play="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;command&quot;,&quot;func&quot;:&quot;playVideo&quot;,&quot;args&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" name="img181" >PCPerspective even has their own in-depth video</a>

<p>It's like putting together a Lego house. Just watch some tutorials and consult us, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BuildAPC" rel="nofollow"  >/r/BuildAPC</a>, or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BuildAPCForMe" rel="nofollow"  >/r/BuildAPCForMe</a>. Picking your own parts and assembling your build is actually pretty fun. There are plenty of YouTube videos out there that will help. Make sure you read up on <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/two-ways-to-cool-down-your-defective-overheating-intel-cpu/" rel="nofollow"  >Intel's Ivy Bridge or Haswell chips</a>
    <div wotsearchtarget="makeuseof.com" style="cursor: pointer; display: inline-block;width: 16px; height: 16px;">&nbsp;</div> if you don't want to deal with the heat surfacing problems. Finally, take a visit to our <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/builds" rel="nofollow"  >builds</a> page and start reading! Really, the only thing you need to do is a static discharge and you're ready to (delicately!) handle the parts.</p>
<h3 id="wiki_mac_osx_and_linux_can_be_installed_and_configured_to_run_perfectly_on_a_laptop_or_desktop_pc">Mac OSX and Linux can be installed and configured to run perfectly on a laptop or desktop PC</h3>
<p>A PC specifically configured to run Mac OSX is often called a "Hackintosh". Since Apple switched to Intel processors around 2005, users have been able to install and set up OSX to run on most PCs since (assuming you use OSX-compatible hardware). Although it does require about an hour or two of effort, the amount you save and gain by going with a PC over a Mac far outnumbers those two hours of work if aligned to an hourly salary of ~$15-40. Our friends over at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hackintosh" rel="nofollow"  >/r/Hackintosh</a> offer a lot of help and information on the topic, check them out!</p>
<p>Of course, if Mac OSX isn't your thing, there's always Linux. Glorious, beautiful, stable, free, and customizable. Among the popular "flavors" are Ubuntu, CrunchBang, Debian, <a href="http://elementaryos.org/" rel="nofollow"  >ElementaryOS</a>
    <div wotsearchtarget="elementaryos.org" style="cursor: pointer; display: inline-block;width: 16px; height: 16px;">&nbsp;</div>, and many others.</p>
<h3 id="wiki_the_virtual_reality_revolution_is_being_led_by_the_pc">The Virtual Reality revolution is being led by the PC</h3>
<p>If you want to enjoy virtual reality gaming (and other forms of entertainment, the PC is an open development platform so the sky's the limit) in its most immersive form, you'll need a PC. High resolution and framerates are <em>absolutely essential</em> for Virtual Reality headsets (like the Oculus Rift) to properly immerse you and fool your brain. The industry's leading VR company said so themselves: <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/oculus-rift-creator-xbox-one-and-ps4-are-far-too-limited-for-what-we-re-planning-1198420" rel="nofollow"  >even the next-gen consoles are far too weak to handle what they plan on doing</a>
    <div wotsearchtarget="techradar.com" style="cursor: pointer; display: inline-block;width: 16px; height: 16px;">&nbsp;</div>. Some people don't want to use VR to control their gameworld, and some don't want to use it to even view the gameworld, which is fine. Virtual reality headwear isn't meant to be a replacement for desktop or livingroom gaming, it's just meant to be an immersive and creative alternative for the games and genres that best support it. Just because you don't want VR doesn't mean you shouldn't get a PC; it just means that your PC budget will probably be a lot lower!</p>
<h3 id="wiki_the_esports_revolution_is_being_led_by_the_pc">The ESports revolution is being led by the PC</h3>
<p>This has caused somewhat of an unexpected explosion in PC popularity in recent years. Consoles don't even compete with PCs in this regard, as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Fctn2Pgik" rel="nofollow"  type="IFRAME" data-embed="//www.youtube.com/embed/w9Fctn2Pgik?enablejsapi=1&amp;enablecastapi=1&amp;start=0" data-pause="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;command&quot;,&quot;func&quot;:&quot;pauseVideo&quot;,&quot;args&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-play="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;command&quot;,&quot;func&quot;:&quot;playVideo&quot;,&quot;args&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" name="img190" >this video</a>

<h3 id="wiki_.22i_was_told_that_pcs_have_compatibility_problems.22">"I was told that PCs have compatibility problems"</h3>
<p>Game developers adhere to popular standards when they make their games. Hardware developers adhere to popular standards when they make hardware. Not doing so would gain them a terrible reputation and most likely bankruptcy. Because of this, games on PC don't have the compatibility issues they used to in the DOS days. In the DOS days, there were no standards to adhere to, and there were thousands of different possible hardware configurations. Almost no games worked with every piece of sound, video, and input hardware. The next time you hear someone complain about PC gaming being a pain because they hate 'checking to see if they have enough video RAM' or 'making sure they have a fast enough processor' or 'whether or not their sound drivers are up-to-date', just punch them and link them here. PC game developers make their game compatible with an enormous possible performance spectrum! Of all people that understand this, you'd expect it to partially be console gamers seeing as consoles are among the weak end of the spectrum. Apparently not, though, because many spew misinformation like this to scare people away from upgrading.</p>
<h3 id="wiki_a_pc_is_much_better_at_making_your_gaming_experience_sharable">A PC is much better at making your gaming experience sharable</h3>
<p>Streaming, screen recording, video editing, in-game chats, voice chat(Mumble or TeamSpeak), video chat(Skype/Google Hangouts), game invites, and everything else... it's all built in. Specifically FRAPS, Movie Maker, Twitch.tv, and Sony Vegas are popular choices among gamers. No need for expensive custom hardware or a separate device for editing the video; just install the software, run it, and hit record. It does it all, and with much higher quality footage than that of a console. In fact, most <a href="http://i.imgur.com/uqCNrZY.jpg" rel="nofollow"   type="IMAGE" name="img191">demos</a><a class="toggleImage expando-button collapsed collapsedExpando image commentImg">&nbsp;</a>
    <div wotsearchtarget="i.imgur.com" style="cursor: pointer; display: inline-block;width: 16px; height: 16px;">&nbsp;</div> and commercials use PCs for 'actual gameplay footage' to sell their consoles and games due to quality/ease.</p>
<h3 id="wiki_a_pc_is_more_family_friendly_than_a_console">A PC is more family friendly than a console</h3>
<p>Contrary to what the commercials show you, a PC is a much better choice for those who want a device capable of entertaining all age groups. It can be hooked up to multiple displays, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/guide#wiki_fact.3A_you_can_turn_one_pc_into_many_and_multiply_its_value" rel="nofollow"  >terminalized with softXpand</a>, access any streaming service, used for schoolwork, used for web games, used from the couch, used at a desk, used <em>remotely</em>, used for communication, and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/guide#wiki_pc_is_the_king_of_legacy_game_and_software_support" rel="nofollow"  >even emulate console titles using any controller you prefer</a>. You name it, someone out there has written an application to make your PC do it. In addition to that, the the PC has very in-depth parental/owner controls. You can add parental controls to user accounts, web browsers, and specific applications. Consoles, on the other hand, offer almost nothing in comparison.</p>
<h3 id="wiki_a_pc_is_better_than_a_console_for_media_consumption">A PC is better than a console for media consumption</h3>
<p>The only reason Microsoft and Sony are advertising media consumption more than games this time around is because of how far behind PCs they were, and because consoles actually make better playback devices than they do gaming machines. They try to claim their consoles have access to <em>everything</em>, but they really don't. <em>Half of all media streaming services on the internet</em> use HTML5 or Flash. Even <em>attempting to access them</em> with the crippled web browsers on the PS4 and XBox One will require a subscription first. Not to mention, the PC has free online access and several much better alternatives to the long-obsolete and broken Internet Explorer (which the XBox One forces you to use!).</p>
<h3 id="wiki_the_pc_is_far_more_socially_capable_than_a_console">The PC is far more socially capable than a console</h3>
<p>More players per server, more "LAN party-optimized" games like GMod, more game modes, and perfect compatibility between different "generations" and forms of PC. See the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/languide" rel="nofollow"  >/r/PCMasterRace Guide to LAN Parties for more information on LAN</a>. PCs also have the ability to use voice and video communication services like Mumble, Steam, Skype, TeamSpeak, and more... for FREE. Everything you can use as a communication tool for a PAID console subscription can be done better on a PC... for free.</p>
<h3 id="wiki_pcs_support_couch_and_local_multiplayer_gaming">PCs support couch and local multiplayer gaming</h3>
<p>Although consoles have traditionally been the platform to offer the best local multiplayer support with support for up to four simultaneous players, that's changing. With the surge in PC power in recent years, there have been <a href="http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/List_of_Local_Multiplayer_Games" rel="nofollow"  >games</a>
    <div wotsearchtarget="pcgamingwiki.com" style="cursor: pointer; display: inline-block;width: 16px; height: 16px;">&nbsp;</div> released that fully support both split-screen and "hotseat" multiplayer (nearly all of which also support <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/controllerguide" rel="nofollow"  >controller input</a>). Some even support up to <em>6 simultaneous</em> players. Of course, even games <em>without</em> local multiplayer support can still be played on the same PC... <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/guide#wiki_fact.3A_you_can_turn_one_pc_into_many_and_multiply_its_value" rel="nofollow"  >up to 16, in fact</a>.

<h3 id="wiki_pcs_come_in_many_shapes_and_sizes">PCs come in many shapes and sizes</h3>
<p>PCs can be built to be small or large. They can be square, round, flat, tall, you name it. <em>You</em> decide what shape best fits your spacial requirements, whether you're buying or building. Both market strategies have in incalculable amount of options. You can get a PC that uses less power than a console. You can get a PC that's quieter than a console. It's great that consoles sit well in those departments, but the PC takes the crown in every one of those categories.</p>

<p>If you can prove it's being used for your work, you can write it off. Even if it's going to have an HD 7990 or Titan. As we've seen in past years, owning a GPU no longer means that you have to play games. Productivity software is becoming increasingly supportive of OpenCL and other GPU compute features and if your work software can leverage it, the IRS has no business telling you that you can't play games with it as well.</p>

There are many sources of confusion. The first is YouTube. Yes, YouTube. Lots of people use YouTube as a test suite to compare 30FPS and 60FPS+. <del>Bad idea! YouTube caps video framerates at 30FPS!</del>. Before doing so, be sure the video you are watching is 60fps compatible as youtube just recently uncapped its video's framerate. The second source of confusion is sometimes an individual's own hardware. This doesn't really apply to the 30-60 debate, but it does apply to 60+. Both Europe and the US tend to adhere to a strict 50/60FPS cap (sans the 'premium' displays you can buy). This would explain why people don't see a difference between 60 and anything more, because the display they're using is only refreshing 60 times a second (60Hz). The <strong>last and final source</strong> of confusion on this matter is <em>whether or not the human eye can distinguish between the individual frames</em> rather than see them as a slideshow. The answer is no, they cannot... which is the entire point! You <em>can</em>, however, see an improvement in fluidity when the Hz (hertz/refresh rate/FPS) of your system and display are increased. <a href="http://www.testufo.com/#test=framerates" rel="nofollow"  >Here's an in-browser 30-vs-60 test if you still don't believe it</a>

    <div wotsearchtarget="30vs60fps.com" style="cursor: pointer; display: inline-block;width: 16px; height: 16px;">&nbsp;</div>
</p>
<p>Also, the argument about ~24FPS providing a "better cinematic experience" is completely made up. The film industry adopted 24FPS as a standard because <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110708155615/http://www.cinemaweb.com/silentfilm/bookshelf/18_kb_2.htm" rel="nofollow"  >back in the 1930s, higher framerate films took up too much physical film and lower framerate films were difficult to synchronize with the audio</a>
    <div wotsearchtarget="web.archive.org" style="cursor: pointer; display: inline-block;width: 16px; height: 16px;">&nbsp;</div>. Games don't need framerate caps because frames are generated in realtime as many times per second as your graphics card can handle, displayed to the screen, and then removed from memory to make room for the next frame.</p>
<h3 id="wiki_anything_with_a_framerate_below_46fps_could_strain_the_human_eye">Anything with a framerate below 46FPS could strain the human eye</h3>
<p>The majority of console titles target 30 (at 1080p) and occasionally a smooth 60 (although at a meager 720p). Due to the severe hardware limitations of the PS4 and XBox One, almost no titles at the time of this writing are capable of both 1080p and 60FPS. Thomas Edison himself <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate#Background" rel="nofollow"  >concluded</a>
     that anything below 46FPS will strain the human eye, with strain increasing as the framerate lowers. This was back in the days of film strips, so the bar is probably a bit lower now than it was then, but eye strain still exists and there's a way to avoid it.</p>

<p>It's hilarious that some people would try to argue this, yet they sometimes do. The problem with a lot of console titles is that the developers have to narrow the field of view to reduce the stress on their target console's weaker hardware. To give you a glimpse of what you're missing out on, see <a href="http://i.imgur.com/eXJoz8N.gif" rel="nofollow"   type="GENERIC_EXPANDO" name="img206">this image</a><a class="toggleImage expando-button collapsed collapsedExpando video-muted commentImg">&nbsp;</a>
    <div wotsearchtarget="i.imgur.com" style="cursor: pointer; display: inline-block;width: 16px; height: 16px;">&nbsp;</div>. Although some titles have the same field of view across all platforms, ones that are graphically intensive (like Battlefield 4, Skyrim, COD, etc) will often have a reduced FOV on the console version. The best part of it all, if you really do prefer a lower FOV in a given game or need to lower it for medical reasons (vertigo, etc) the PC version will almost always offer an FOV slider or other way to change the FOV. The <a href="http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Category:Games" rel="nofollow"  >PCGamingWiki</a>
    <div wotsearchtarget="pcgamingwiki.com" style="cursor: pointer; display: inline-block;width: 16px; height: 16px;">&nbsp;</div> is and absolutely superb resource for information on how to tweak the FOV (among other things, like resolution and detail).</p>
<h3 id="wiki_academic_studies_have_proven_that_higher_framerates_increase_player_performance">Academic studies have proven that higher framerates increase player performance</h3>
<p>Researchers at the University of Massachusetts <a href="http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~claypool/papers/fr-rez/paper.pdf" rel="nofollow"  >have determined through observation</a>
    <div wotsearchtarget="web.cs.wpi.edu" style="cursor: pointer; display: inline-block;width: 16px; height: 16px;">&nbsp;</div> that not only is the difference noticeable, but player performance increases logarithmically up to 60FPS (logarithmically means the largest increases happen early on and begin to taper off, see rough example <a href="https://people.richland.edu/james/lecture/m116/logs/logarithmic.gif" rel="nofollow"  type="IMAGE" name="img209" >here</a>

Unfortunately, they didn't test with framerates <em>over</em> 60, so we can intelligently theorize (but not scientifically prove) that this also applies to framerates beyond 60. They also concluded (since the curve is logarithmic) that framerates <em>lower</em> than 30 get almost exponentially worse, which is unfortunate because almost every "next-gen" demo so far has shown to dip as low as 10-20FPS while rendering heavier scenes.</p>

<p>Let's face the facts. PCs aren't consoles; they improve every year and game developers adjust their games accordingly. If you get sick of running your games on medium and low instead of your traditional high or ultra, overclocking may be the answer. Overclocking is free and it's not as dangerous as it sounds. Performance gains vary, but once your parts are out of their warranty period you no longer have to worry about voiding it. Normally, even a small increase would void it. Of course, you could always just buy faster hardware, but thanks to overclocking you may not need to... at least for another year or so.</p>

Another big factor is the resolution output of your PC. TVs of today are 1080p and higher; sometimes even 4K (4x as dense as 1080p)! Mainstream consoles can hardly handle 900p, let alone 1080p... Using a PC with these TVs rather than an underpowered console will ensure you hit the level of clarity the TV was <em>designed</em> for, not what the console drags it down to. Any resolution other than a display's native resolution will look blurry in comparison to what it was designed for, and you'll notice this pretty quick when you hook your PC up to your TV.</p>

<p>Modern consoles like the PS4 and XBox One use an enhanced AMD A10, which is a mid-range budget processor. Back when the XBox 360 and PS3 came out, things were different. The XBox 360 and PS3 were both very competitive with equivalent PCs, and they were <strong>sold at a tremendous loss, even with their $700 price tags</strong>. Consoles now are being sold for $400-$500 and making healthy profits on the hardware alone, (at least after their first single game and round of online access payments, if not immediately) ... and yet they continue to raise the prices for online access/special services and increase their cuts for per-game sales. The last-gen prices aren't even adjusted to inflation, either! It really says something about console innovation when you have to adjust for inflation to compare across generations, doesn't it?</p>
<h3 id="wiki_console_gaming_was_.28at_one_point.29_far_better_than_anything_pcs_had_to_offer">Console gaming was (at one point) far better than anything PCs had to offer</h3>
<p>We don't try to hide the truth here. Quite the opposite, actually. Yes, at one point consoles had far better graphical capabilities than the PC. Up until the popularity boom of the Apple II and Commodore 64, PCs were barely more than word processors. But then it became 1985. Consoles have continued to stick around over the years but their time has long passed. The only advantages that consoles have left (since the late 80's) are market share, high profitability for the companies building them, <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2014-05-29-the-astronauts-in-2014-USD60-for-a-game-is-a-little-insane" rel="nofollow"  >expensive games</a>
    <div wotsearchtarget="gamesindustry.biz" style="cursor: pointer; display: inline-block;width: 16px; height: 16px;">&nbsp;</div>, and exclusives. The middle being hardly anything to brag about as a console user (hey, look how much I spent on this!). These days, games aren't exclusive simply because that's the only system that can handle it; <a href="http://www.gamesradar.com/paying-exclusivity-why-its-here-stay/" rel="nofollow"  >games are exclusives because Microsoft and Sony use their ill-earned profits to influence starving developers</a>

    <div wotsearchtarget="forbes.com" style="cursor: pointer; display: inline-block;width: 16px; height: 16px;">&nbsp;</div>. Look at that, PS4 owner.

<h3 id="wiki_pcs_can_be_legally_opened_for_cleaning.2C_upgrades.2C_and_repairs">PCs can be legally opened for cleaning, upgrades, and repairs</h3>
<p>Let's face it. If your device relies on fan cooling or has vents, it's going to get dusty and eventually very hot. If it contains circuit boards, it's going to be susceptible to power surges and other electrical problems. It doesn't matter who builds the products or where it comes from. No electronic device is invulnerable. Luckily for you, you get to handle things yourself if/when your PC has a problem with an individual part. Consoles aren't so forgiving. If you clean it yourself, the warranty is most likely void. If a part fails, you have to send the entire thing in and wait for it to be sent back. Sometimes you can even continue using the PC while waiting for the individual part to be replaced! Things like RAM cards, hard drives, graphics cards are good examples. Get a PC and you won't have to be afraid of voiding a warranty ever again as long as you're not physically violating the warranty agreement for the part. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/2djjFBh.png" rel="nofollow"   type="IMAGE" name="img220">Repairing is frowned upon with the XBox most of all</a><a class="toggleImage expando-button collapsed collapsedExpando image commentImg">&nbsp;</a>

<p>Each individual part that you view online has a warranty policy directly from the manufacturer that you can see a summary of. Many parts (like Patriot RAM) even have <em>lifetime</em> warranties.

Even putting $500 into a PC will get you a system more powerful than each, with the full library of even the most demanding PC titles. PC has the most exclusives for a reason, though. Due to the healthy, open, and competitive PC market, independent developers tend to gravitate toward the PC. Console companies are generally hostile toward independent developers and not nearly as many can easily make their game available to console markets.

Not to mention, <strong>consoles are what trudged in and created the exclusivity issue in the first place, hoping that you'd reward them for it and buy into their cancerous ecosystem.</strong> In a situation where you have a choice of many, pick the best of the group: PC.</p>

Console controllers are a close #2 in gamer preference on the PC. Some games (like Super Meat Boy) can actually be easier with a controller. You can plug a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Windows/dp/B004QRKWKQ/" rel="nofollow"  >console controller</a>
    <div wotsearchtarget="amazon.com" style="cursor: pointer; display: inline-block;width: 16px; height: 16px;">&nbsp;</div> right into your PC and be on your way. Very little configuration is needed, it just kind of works on its own after it's plugged in. This is a lot of fun when you use emulators for console titles. Isn't freedom of choice a beautiful thing?</p>

<p>Thanks to emulators and the raw power of modern PCs, you can run any game or application.

    <div wotsearchtarget="i.imgur.com" style="cursor: pointer; display: inline-block;width: 16px; height: 16px;">&nbsp;</div>. So, if you want to go with what's the healthiest for you and the industry... go PC. The misinformation about PC "dying" is typically spewed by angry people that want to recruit others into the ecosystem that they decided was best (probably just because they were already trapped in it). Developers (the people who make the games that drove you to choose a platform in the first place) also prefer PC, because they don't lose half of their profits to manufacturing and exorbitant fees. Lastly and most importantly, gamers are switching back. Ultimately because <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1ypsxy/why_ive_returned_to_pc_gaming/" rel="nofollow"  >the PC is cheaper, more open, customizable, easier to fix, and capable of so much more</a>.</p>
<h3 id="wiki_consoles_are_no_longer_the_industry_innovation_leaders">Consoles are no longer the industry innovation leaders</h3>
<p>Back when the SNES/N64/PSX came out, it was a different time. Now, it may seem that consoles are to thank for graphical fidelity making leaps every eight years, but they're not. The reason gaming takes a leap forward every time a new generation of consoles come out is because <em>they're what was holding it back in the first place</em>. Think about it: 70% of the target audience of any given game will <em>have</em> to be playable on continuously aging console hardware. That means that the developers have to <em>make sure</em> that their game will run on said machines, with or without the features they desire. Many of their ideas and features they could have implemented are thrown out the window because the hardware simply can't handle it. As a result, the developers are forced to sell a stripped-down product. Of course, PC users will most often get a better product if the same title lands in their hands, but it's never exactly what the developer originally expected. In some rare cases, the PC port is terrible... but only because the developers are unable to allocate as much time and money to the PC branch of the project. There's a line they have to draw somewhere in between the capabilities of the console and the capabilities of the PC. A fine example of this would be Crysis, a game which launched on consoles <a href="http://i.imgur.com/C0HPPea.jpg" rel="nofollow"   type="IMAGE" name="img257"><em>four years</em> after it was released on PC</a><a class="toggleImage expando-button collapsed collapsedExpando image commentImg">&nbsp;</a>
    <div wotsearchtarget="i.imgur.com" style="cursor: pointer; display: inline-block;width: 16px; height: 16px;">&nbsp;</div>. There have been occasional instances where the developer will rebuild the game (graphically) from scratch to make sure that the PC version fulfills their vision, but even <em>that</em> is rare. So... the less people that are purchasing consoles, the less of a stranglehold Microsoft and Sony will have on the industry. The more people that are on PC, the more wiggle room the developers have to make their game the best it can be. If you enjoy seeing games get better, go with a PC.</p>
<h3 id="wiki_hardware_companies_and_game_companies_make_more_money_from_pcs_than_they_do_consoles">Hardware companies and game companies make more money from PCs than they do consoles</h3>
<p>Yes, it's true. Even at full price on a console, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCsgzRxIsmY" rel="nofollow" >developers make more money from it being sold on Steam for 75% off</a>
    <div wotsearchtarget="youtube.com" style="cursor: pointer; display: inline-block;width: 16px; height: 16px;">&nbsp;</div><span class="RESdupeimg"><a class="noKeyNav" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/guide#img174" title="click to scroll to original" >[RES ignored duplicate link]</a></span>. Why? Because developing for PC has no per-sale royalty fees, no development kit fees, no submission fees, and no cost of physically manufacturing/shipping/stocking their finished products. Your money goes straight to the developer's pocket, and the game directly onto your PC. Hardware makers earn much healthier margins on PC as well, since they aren't relying on eventual-profit-by-volume under some tremendously long-term supply contract for Microsoft or Sony. If you care about <a href="http://i.imgur.com/9wvvcag.png" rel="nofollow" >saving money for yourself</a>
    <div wotsearchtarget="i.imgur.com" style="cursor: pointer; display: inline-block;width: 16px; height: 16px;">&nbsp;</div><span class="RESdupeimg"><a class="noKeyNav" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/guide#img173" title="click to scroll to original" >[RES ignored duplicate link]</a></span>, go with the PC. If you care about funding developers and keeping your favorite games flowing, go with the PC. If you care about the hardware companies like AMD and nVidia that make modern gaming possible, go with the PC. Once again, consoles exist only to suck money out of developers, hardware companies, and gamers. It's plain as day: Sony and Microsoft don't care about anything but money. If they really cared about improving the state of gaming, why are they sucking every possible entity dry at every possible stage of the process? <em>Literally</em>, for the <em>love of gaming</em>, go with a PC.</p>
<h3 id="wiki_used_game_sales_are_more_destructive_to_the_industry_than_piracy_and_sales">Used game sales are more destructive to the industry than piracy and sales</h3>
<p>According to Lionhead studios, this is <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/used-video-games-market-more-damaging-than-piracy-110518/" rel="nofollow"  >true</a>
    <div wotsearchtarget="torrentfreak.com" style="cursor: pointer; display: inline-block;width: 16px; height: 16px;">&nbsp;</div>. At least for them, anyways. It makes sense that this would affect all console developers equally, though. This won't be an issue much longer, however, because the console industry is beginning to restrict used game sales to the point where your physical game is more like a receipt than an actual game.</p>
<p>This isn't an attempt at silencing the piracy problem as a whole, because piracy is a problem... but: it's not <em>just</em> PC. All platforms suffer from it, even mobile! It's just important to remember, if you're going to try and attack piracy in the name of the developer, you should remember to attack used game sales just as much (if the real motive is to help developers, which in most cases it's really just an attempt to justify an attack on the PC platform).</p>
<h3 id="wiki_piracy_is_actually_more_of_a_problem_on_consoles_than_it_is_on_the_pc">Piracy is actually more of a problem on consoles than it is on the PC</h3>
<p>There's a lot of undeserved misinformation flying around, usually sounding something like, "PC gamers are a bunch of pirates"/"PC isn't getting this game because they're all pirates"/"Developers did this or that because they're punishing them for being pirates". In reality, as concluded by Intel's research, <a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2012/09/22/gaming-piracy-separating-fact-from-fiction" rel="nofollow"  >the majority of piracy you see today takes place on consoles</a>
    <div wotsearchtarget="software.intel.com" style="cursor: pointer; display: inline-block;width: 16px; height: 16px;">&nbsp;</div>! The massive drop in piracy can likely be credited to easy, cheap, and even free distribution methods and services such as Good Old Games and Steam. Judging by Intel's research, it looks like the only people who really claim piracy is a massive problem on PC are the ones who are known for terrible DRM or hate it purely out of jealousy toward Valve (EA, Ubisoft).</p>
<h3 id="wiki_most_of_the_screenshots_and_gameplay_you_see_on_.22next-gen.22_advertisements_are_actually_from_a_pc">Most of the screenshots and gameplay you see on "next-gen" advertisements are actually from a PC</h3>
<p>See the image below? That's Microsoft XBox team themselves at a popular game convention using PCs to demonstrate how "good" the XBox One looks! If the XBox team themselves are incapable of convincing you that PC is superior, nothing will. Seeing as <strong>all console games are developed on PCs and then skimmed down for consoles</strong>, it's only natural that they use footage from the best-looking system to try and sell their product. Sony and Microsoft both know that the truth is far from pretty, so they source their media from a high-end PC rather than a console. They think you'll forget by the time you buy their system anyhow. They don't care about it <em>actually</em> looking good, they just expect you to forget by the time you pay them upwards of $500 for everything. The question is, will you let them?</p>

<p>Hello, reader! I hope you liked this guide, it's taken me a long time to build. If you liked it, all I ask is that you spread the word. It makes me feel bad knowing that there are people out there with perfectly capable PCs, but they have no idea they can do half of this stuff. It makes me feel even worse knowing that there are people out there that were misled into buying consoles and paying for online access because they had no idea that a measly $100 would have turned their 'office box' into a console crusher. My goal is not to obtain money, karma, or anything else. I just wanted an area to share my knowledge with as many people as possible and I think I've found it here on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PCMasterRace" rel="nofollow"  >/r/PCMasterRace</a>. The greatest reward (to me) is knowing that someone was able to make a better purchase because of this guide. Thanks for reading, and if you really liked it or have any questions, please send me a PM and let me know! <a href="http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Tizaki&amp;subject=Guide&amp;message=Hello." rel="nofollow"  >Contact me</a> to leave feedback.</p>
